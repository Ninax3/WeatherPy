# Summary
The purpose of this analysis is to add weather data and a weather decription to a dataframe of randomly selected latitudes and longitudes for cities around the globe. As part of a beta test for a PlanMyTrip app, a datafame was created for nearby hotels for the cities dataframe. Furthermore four cities were selected to create a travel itinerar and a travel route between the four selected cities in Mexico and the U.S. Maps were created with markers and are in the Vacation_Itinerary and Vacation_Search folders.
